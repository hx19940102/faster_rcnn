# faster_rcnn

Faster RCNN implementation based on Girshick et al.'s paper[https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5638-faster-r-cnn-towards-real-time-object-detection-with-region-proposal-networks.pdf].

This project includes the model of Regional Proposal Network and the model of Fast-RCNN. Non-maximal suppresion is used for removing overlapping bounding boxes. The training of rpn and fast-rcnn is seperated.
